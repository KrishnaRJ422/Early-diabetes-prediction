# Early-diabetes-risk-prediction
This work is a part of Predictive Analytics course submission in MBA third semester.
This model uses 4 classification techniques to perform a comparative study to find optimized model to predict early risk of diabetes.
In this techniques KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Baye's, SVM are used.
Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-score, Classification Error Rate, Precision are metrics that were compared.
Out of the 4 techniques used, SVM is giving better accuracy for the dataset considered https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.
